Here are the updated notes:

## Development Process & Priorities

**MVP-first mentality.** I'm comfortable building this with any tech stack - React/TypeScript, Vue, Svelte, even pure Rust with egui or native desktop frameworks. Could have gone full enterprise mode with proper state management, testing suites, CI/CD pipelines, the works. But the goal was speed to working product. Converting this to ultra-best-practice web architecture isn't the hard part - proving the concept and getting user feedback is.

**Started pragmatic, stayed pragmatic.** I began with the single HTML prototype because I wanted to get the core functionality working first - connecting to the testnet, showing real metrics, giving developers the info they actually need. No point building fancy desktop features if the basic monitoring doesn't work.

**Real developer problems first.** The "Should I Deploy?" button was the key insight - developers don't want to dig through metrics, they want a simple answer. Same with the confidence breakdown - make the complex simple, but keep the detail accessible when needed.

**Cross-platform was messier than expected.** Hit some walls with MSVC compilation, ended up going with the GNU target which works great but taught me that "just cross-compile" isn't always straightforward. Sometimes the practical solution beats the "proper" one.

## Key Trade-offs

**Speed vs. architecture.** Could have spent days setting up proper bundling, state management, component architecture, TypeScript, testing frameworks. Instead chose to validate the core idea first with working code. Technical debt is only debt if you're not learning from users.

**External dependencies vs. bundling everything.** Went with CDNs for Tailwind/FontAwesome to move fast, knowing it creates internet dependency. For a developer tool connecting to a live network anyway, seemed like acceptable trade-off. Could bundle later if needed.

**Security vs. simplicity.** Disabled CSP to get things working quickly. Not ideal for a production browser app, but for a developer desktop tool? The productivity gain was worth it.

**Features vs. polish.** Focused on the core workflow - connect, monitor, decide - rather than bells and whistles. Better to have 5 features that work perfectly than 15 that are half-baked.

## Assumptions Made

- Developers care more about "is it safe to deploy right now?" than historical trends
- Desktop app fits better in dev workflow than another browser tab
- Visual confidence scoring is more useful than raw numbers
- Testnet reliability is the main blocker for development teams

## Future Evolution Ideas

**Short term:** Add some basic alerting when network conditions change significantly. Maybe system notifications when confidence drops below a threshold.

**Medium term:** Historical view would be huge - seeing patterns over time, understanding when the network typically has issues. Also mainnet support obviously.

**Long term:** CI/CD integration could be game-changing. Imagine your deployment pipeline automatically checking network health before releasing. Or Slack/Discord bots giving team updates.

**Wild ideas:** Multi-network dashboard for teams working across different chains. Custom confidence scoring based on your specific deployment risk tolerance.

The core insight is that blockchain developer tooling often focuses on the protocol level, but developers need operational awareness too. This bridges that gap in a simple way.
